SafeChicago
===========

## Project Overview
SafeChicago is a two-part guide to crime in Chicago. Its first component is mapping software that dynamically computes the safest route to your destination, accounting for your preference for safety. The software applies Dijkstra's algorithm to compute each route, weighting streets by their length as well as the amount and types of historical crimes that have taken place near them and accounting for variables such as time of day and season. Step-by-step directions are then generated by Google Maps. The software's second component is an interactive map with crime information for all the districts in Chicago. For each district, statistics are generated giving information such as the street in the district with the highest crime levels and information on crime levels in the district by time of day, month, and season. In addition, a histogram of crime levels for each street in the district is provided.

## Important Note:
- In order to save this in Github, some files were compressed into .zip format. Uncompress the following files before running to ensure the software runs properly:
- data/crime_data_2017.csv
- safechicago/pickle_files/adjusted_street_com.p
- safechicago/pickle_files/street_com.p
